      <h1>Musical fingers game in a nut shell</h1>
      <p>Basic idea: As we mentioned above this game practice hand opposition function which may help in improving the patient ability of moving his/her fingers which is vital in many of the everyday activities. So, the game is so much like piano tiles, instead of moving black blocks, pictures demonstrating hand opposition exercises are moving down and the patient earns a point by simulating the specific move appearing in front of him/her before it reaches the end of the screen.

Graduation of difficulty: This game contains only one level with varying difficulty between easy, medium and hard, the more the difficult the game is the faster it goes down.
